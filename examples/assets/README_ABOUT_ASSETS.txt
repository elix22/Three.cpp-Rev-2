I used some of the assets from other tutorials,
but I haven't had time to check the permission of this.

I'm using the assets as current tests, but it will be removed later on or the proper permission / license will be requested.

If you're the author of the original asset, feel free to ask me to take down the asset if you feel need to.


Thanks.
